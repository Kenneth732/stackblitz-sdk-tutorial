# Installing the SDK

StackBlitz SDK can be used in any JavaScript project. You can add it to your site using an npm package or [with a CDN](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/api/javascript-sdk#install-the-sdk).

For this tutorial, we will be working with a barebones Vite project and will use npm.

## Your task

Let's start by installing the SDK package. Toggle the terminal on your right and run the following command:

```bash
npm install @stackblitz/sdk
```

After the package is installed, you can import the SDK in your project. In the `main.js` file add the following import statement at the top:

```js
import sdk from '@stackblitz/sdk';
```
