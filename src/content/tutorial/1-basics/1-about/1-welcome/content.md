# StackBlitz SDK

The StackBlitz JavaScript <abbr title="Software Development Kit">SDK</abbr> lets you programmatically create StackBlitz projects to be opened in a new window or embedded in your docs, example pages, or blog posts.

Once embedded, the projects can be controlled by using the SDKâ€™s VM interface.

1. initialize a coding environment,
2. source the code,
3. and use it do implement a "run this code" feature.
