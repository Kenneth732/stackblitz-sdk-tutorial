# Welcome to a TutorialKit editor!

This is an interactive editor you will be using to work with the tutorial.

Here is a quick overview of the tutorial's editor UI:

- If a lesson has more than one source file to view, 
you can switch between them using the "Files" panel on the left.

- Below you can see a "Preview" which will show the project
you're building. It automatically updates whenever you edit the code
(You can try opening the `page.html` on the left and make some edits!)

- If you're stuck on a specific task, you can use the "ðŸ’¡ Solve" button
on the top-right of the editor.

Have fun and good luck!
