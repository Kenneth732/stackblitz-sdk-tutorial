# Opening a project

In the previous chapter, we've learned how to embed a project on a page using the `.embedProjectId()` method. This time, we will do 2 things differently:

- Instead of _embedding_ a project, we will _open_ it in a new window. This is why, the SDK method we will use is named `.openProject()`.

- Instead of using an already existing project, we will create a new one from scratch. (Note that the method name is `.openProject()` and not `.embedProjectId()`.)

The method takes 2 arguments: the required project configuration and the optional settings object. The absolute minimum you need to provide for the setup is the `files` object, where the key is the file path and the value is the file content, for instance: 

```js
files: {
  'src/app.html': `<div id="app"></div>`,
}
```

## Your task

Use the `.openProject()` method to create a new project with the following 2 files: `index.html` and `index.js`. The HTML file can display a `<h1>Hello, StackBlitz!</h1>` message, and you can leave the JavaScript empty.

```js
'index.js': ``,
'index.html': `<h1>Hello, StackBlitz!</h1>`,
```

When clicking the "open" button in the preview, a new StackBlitz project should now open in a new window. It's very minimal for now, but we will build on it in the next chapters.
