# Creating files

Our minimal React project will consists of the following files:

- `index.html` - the main HTML file that includes the `#root` element
- `index.tsx` - the main TypeScript file that renders the React app
- `Demo.tsx` - the main React component

We could get away with just the `index.html` and `index.tsx` files, but separating the component code in a `Demo.tsx` file will allow us to keep the project organized and make it easier to reuse the same setup for other components.

## Your task

Update the `files` object in the `.openProject()` method to create the following files:

```js title=index.html
`<div id="root"></div>`
```

```js title=index.tsx
`import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Demo from './Demo';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector("#root")).render(
  <Demo />
);`
```

```js title=Demo.tsx
// This code is stored in the imported "sourceCode" variable. 
// Use the variable instead of hardcoding the content.
```

Our project should _almost_ work now! There seem to be some dependencies missing. Let's fix that in the next lesson.
