# Defining dependencies

Our project misses some dependencies. We are using TypeScript, so we need to add the `@types/react` package to the project. We also use `@mui/material`, so that needs to be specified as well.

`dependencies` is another property in our project configuration object. Similar to `files`, it is an object where the key is the dependency name and the value is the version. You can also specify `*` to get the latest version.

## Your task

Add the `dependencies` object to the project configuration in the `.openProject()` method:

```js
dependencies: {
  'react': '*',
  '@types/react': '*',
  '@mui/material': '*',
  'react-dom': '*',
}
```

Now, the project works!

There's one more thing worth adjusting. Currently, when our users open the live example, they will always see the "index.html" file. We'd like to show them something more relevant.

Let's fix that in the next lesson.
