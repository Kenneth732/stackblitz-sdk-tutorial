# Template setup

Before we continue defining the files for our live example, we need to tell StackBlitz how to interpret them. We can do it with a [`template`](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/api/javascript-sdk-options#projecttemplate) setting. 

Our example is a React project, so we will use the `create-react-app` template. This template will set up the project with the basic dependencies and configuration files.

## Your task

Add the `template: 'create-react-app'` option to the project configuration in the `.openProject()` method.

When you click the "open" button in the preview, you can notice that the project now has a `package.json` file, a content customized for a React project.

It's time to put the actual React code in our project. Let's move on to the next lesson!
